POP R1 <--- pop on empty stack?


Need to: Keep track of the top of the stack:
1. how do i keep track of the top of the stack?
    Use a register, stack pointer (SP)
2. we need a place to store data
    Memory ->  Let's use main memory


------


Memory 

FF: 00
FE: 00
FD: 00
FC: 00
F3: 12  (from 00 to 12, because RO (12), was pushed )
F2: 32 xxx
F1: 4A <--- SP
